    The website is built using GatsbyJS, a modern web framework that leverages the latest web technologies to ensure fast page loads and 
    a smooth user experience. To enhance visual appeal and user interaction, the site incorporates subtle animations that guide visitors 
    through content seamlessly, making navigation both intuitive and engaging.
    A key feature of this website is the custom Gatsby source plugin developed to seamlessly integrate with the Tix API. 
    This plugin automates the interaction between the website and Tix, facilitating updates and information retrieval without 
    any manual intervention from the user.
    Additionally, the website provides digital access to Harpa’s annual report, offering insights into its operations, events, 
    and financials through an easy-to-navigate interface. This has been achieved with the combination of TypeScript for robust coding, 
    Tailwind CSS for responsive and aesthetic design, and Contentful, which serves as the headless CMS, enabling dynamic content management 
    and scalability
